# CarPoolForAdelphi
Car Pool App for Adelphi University - Computer Networks Class 
README file that explains how to use the application 
(and the status, e.g. what features were implemented thus far, to what extent the feature requiring 
synchronization was completed, and how you would proceed to enhance the application given more time), 
output of your test cases (screenshots), and the latest versions of your requirements and design documents. 
The enhanced version should have a feature that requires synchronized communication 
(shared access to an object e.g. Producer-Consumer lab).

## Status 
Driver and Passenger views were implemented. Driver can add new ride, and check his rides and car. 
Passenger can view all rides, and join to the ride. Syncronization... 

## TestCases 
We have created multiple Test cases to find the breaks in our app. Also, we have created several exceptions to catch errors.

## How I built it

## Challenges We ran into
In the early stages, we encounter design issues. Nevertheless, we were able to solve this problem by creating a smart design that allows us to expand the project in the future.
Another challege we had was passing ride and rideList objects.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
Even though, we had limited time, we were able to create fully usible version of our app. In future versions we are planning to use GUI and increase number of features. 
## What I learned
We learn how to train the ML models.
